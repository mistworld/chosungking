Subject: Workers Assets Not Deploying - Persistent "Assets have not yet been deployed..." Error

Dear Cloudflare Support Team,

I am experiencing a critical issue with deploying static assets to my Cloudflare Worker, and I need your assistance to resolve this.

---

**ACCOUNT INFORMATION:**
- Account ID: 921d8b061ab8fb98eb58d093acfbaddb
- Worker Name: chosung-game
- Domain: chosung-game.sucksuck1114.workers.dev

---

**PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:**

Despite successful Worker deployments, static assets are not being deployed. The deployment dashboard consistently shows:
- "Assets have not yet been deployed..."
- Worker code deploys successfully
- All bindings (KV, Durable Objects) work correctly
- Static files in the `./public` directory are never uploaded

**ERROR MESSAGES:**

1. In Deployment Dashboard:
   - "Assets have not yet been deployed..."

2. API Error (persistent):
   - `GET /api/v4/accounts/921d8b061ab8fb98eb58d093acfbaddb/workers/tails/by-consumer/chosung-game/environment/production`
   - HTTP 502 Bad Gateway

---

**CONFIGURATION:**

My `wrangler.toml` configuration:

```toml
name = "chosung-game"
main = "src/worker.js"
type = "module"
compatibility_date = "2024-11-19"
workers_dev = true

[build]
command = ""

[assets]
directory = "./public"

[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "ROOM_LIST"
id = "fdd09a3f8360417b8b710dcbc0ad1d93"

[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "WORD_CACHE"
id = "c2668ae36bf64d74b174663e61f91d53"

[[durable_objects.bindings]]
name = "GAME_STATE"
class_name = "GameStateRoom"
script_name = "chosung-do-worker-2024"
```

**Worker Code:**
- Uses `env.ASSETS.fetch(request)` for static file serving
- All API routes function correctly
- Game logic is complete and working locally

---

**DEPLOYMENT LOGS:**

During deployment, I see:
```
🌀 Building list of assets...
✨ Read 27 files from the assets directory C:\Users\...\public
🌀 Starting asset upload...
No updated asset files to upload. Proceeding with deployment...
Total Upload: 39.84 KiB / gzip: 8.22 KiB
```

The system reads the files but doesn't upload them, even after modifying files to force updates.

---

**ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE:**

1. ✅ Verified `wrangler.toml` configuration (assets directory correctly set)
2. ✅ Added `type = "module"` to wrangler.toml
3. ✅ Modified files to force asset re-upload
4. ✅ Cleared all routes, custom domains, and Pages connections
5. ✅ Enabled workers.dev domain in Dashboard
6. ✅ Deployed with `npx wrangler deploy` (v4.49.0)
7. ✅ Verified Worker code includes `env.ASSETS.fetch(request)`

None of these resolved the issue.

---

**EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:**
- Static assets from `./public` directory should be deployed with the Worker
- Accessing `https://chosung-game.sucksuck1114.workers.dev/` should serve `index.html`
- Assets should be accessible via `env.ASSETS.fetch(request)`

**ACTUAL BEHAVIOR:**
- Dashboard shows "Assets have not yet been deployed..."
- Worker responds with this placeholder message
- No assets are accessible

---

**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:**

- Local development works perfectly (game logic, API, static files)
- This is a real-time multiplayer game requiring low latency
- Worker code and bindings are functional; only assets deployment fails
- 502 errors suggest platform-level issues, not configuration errors

---

**REQUEST:**

Could you please:
1. Investigate why assets are not being deployed despite correct configuration
2. Check for any account-level or Worker-level restrictions blocking asset deployment
3. Resolve the 502 API errors related to Workers Tails endpoint
4. Verify that the assets deployment system is functioning for this Worker

This is blocking the launch of my application. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and support.
